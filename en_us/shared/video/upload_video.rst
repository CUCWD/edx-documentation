To upload a video to a third party hosting site, follow the instructions for
that site. Keep the following guidelines in mind.

* The URL for the video that you upload on a third party hosting site must end
  in .mp4, .mpeg, .webm, or .ogg. The video player cannot support videos that
  you upload on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo.

  To help make sure all standard browsers can play your video, edX strongly
  recommends that you use .mp4 format.

  The video URL might resemble the following example.

  ``https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-videos/edx-edx101/EDXSPCPJSP13-G030300.mp4``

* After you upload a video on a hosting site, you must make sure you have the
  URL for that copy of the video. If you upload copies of your video on more
  than one hosting site, make sure you have the URL for each video location.

* If you have copies of a video in multiple resolutions, you must follow the
  instructions for your hosting site to upload each copy. For more information,
  see :ref:`Video Guidelines`.

For more information about hosting your videos, see :ref:`Set Up a Hosting
Service`.
